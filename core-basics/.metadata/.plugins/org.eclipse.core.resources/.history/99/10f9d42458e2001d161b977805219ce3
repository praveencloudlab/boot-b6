	 * 	=====================
	 *  -> too many dependency objects
	 *  	-> performace goes down
	 *  	-> memory issues
	 *  
	 *  why this issues happened?
	 *  ============================
	 *  -> dependent class creating dependency objects directly
	 *  
	 *  What is the solution?
	 *  =========================
	 *  -> Never create dependency objects in the dependent class
	 *  -> Use techniques like JNDI .. etc
	 * 		-> location of JNDI is tightly coupled with dependent class
	 *
