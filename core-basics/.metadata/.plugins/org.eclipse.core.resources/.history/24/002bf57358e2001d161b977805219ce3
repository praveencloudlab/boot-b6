	 * 	Design issues
	 * 	=====================
	 *  -> too many dependency objects
	 *  	-> Performance goes down
	 *  	-> memory issues
	 *  
	 *  why this issues happened?
	 *  ============================
	 *  -> dependent class creating dependency objects directly
	 *  
	 *  What is the solution?
	 *  =========================
	 *  -> Never create dependency objects in the dependent class
	 *  -> Use techniques like JNDI .. etc
	 * 		-> location of JNDI is tightly coupled with dependent class
	 * 
	 *  what is best solution?
	 *  =========================
	 *  -> do not create / look up, instead ask some one (container) to inject: IoC (Inversion of Control)
	 * 
	 *
